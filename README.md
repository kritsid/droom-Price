DISCRIPTION

This project is implementing droom prediction dataset, where machine has been trained to predict the droom price based on user input parameters
ABOUT PROJECT
UI is using streamlit
Initially model has een preprocessed, features have been extracted, scaling has been done on features. this is followed by training the model
ML model is using XGboost classifier

ABOUT DATASET
The droom prediction dataset 3910 rows and has 9 columns. DATASET CAN BE FOUND in the repository itself.
